 *Wema*

**Wema** is a random act of kindness android app. It challenges a user everyday with a random act of kindess but also gives them
the fexibility to create their own random acts of kindness. Users can also write a reflection after they do the random act of 
kindess(RAK). The user has the ability to control the privacy of the reflection by setting it as private or public and they can
also add a location where they did the random act of kindness. In the feed, the user can infinitely scroll through public posts.
They can also click on a post to  open a detail page where they can see more details about the post. In the detail page, they can
clap on a post or share the post to their favorite social media platform. Our places feature also enables users to look through 
a map where they can see different random acts of kindness and where they were done. 
Time spent: **4** weeks.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
We had issues with the Parse Server. In the course of testing we uploaded many images until our database got filled.This wasn't imeadiately clear since we only got an error that "Could not store file".However, we figured this later and emptied our database.
